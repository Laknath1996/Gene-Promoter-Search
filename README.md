# Genomic Signal Processing
Includes the scripts and data used for the assignments given in the BM4321 - Genomic Signal Processing module. The scripts are currently
written in scilab. (Scilab scripts are inspired by Dr. Upeka Premaratne's BM4321 Lab Classes)

## Promoter Search

The promoter_search folder includes scripts written for performing intact query local search, non-intact query local search,
and statistical alignment methods to search for promoters of both sense strand and anti-sense strand genes of a eukaryotic genome.

## Phylogenetic Tree

The phylogenetic_tree folder includes the scripts written for performing physlogenetic analysis on the acetobacter genus.
